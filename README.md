# Analysis for fun
Two nice exercises for dealing with some real data analyst challenges, Inspired by Keith Galli's excellent [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq6XkhO5SZ66N04IcPbqNcw).

## Exercise 1: Sales data analysis
You can find the data [here](https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Analysis-for-fun/tree/main/Sales%20data%20analysis/Sales_Data).<br/>
And the questions and answers you can found [here](https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Analysis-for-fun/blob/main/Sales%20data%20analysis/Sales%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb).<br/><br/>
__Prerequisites:__
In order to run the notebook on your local machine you will need the following directories:
* pandas
* os
* matplotlib

## Exercise 2: Disney web scarping
In this project I created structured and unstructured data just from Wikipedia web pages.<br/><br/>
You can find the final json data [here](https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Analysis-for-fun/blob/main/Disney%20web%20scraping/disney_data.json) and the final csv file [here](https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Analysis-for-fun/blob/main/Disney%20web%20scraping/movie_data.csv).<br/>
And the full code you can find [here](https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Analysis-for-fun/blob/main/Disney%20web%20scraping/Disney%20web%20scraping.ipynb).
<br/><br/>
__Prerequisites:__
In order to run the notebook on your local machine you will need the following directories:
* requests
* json 
* bs4
* os
* tqdm
* pandas

## Soon... Disney data analysis
